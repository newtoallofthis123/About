            Hi! I am Ishan! I go by <a href="https://noobscience.rocks">NoobScience</a>
            online. I am a student and technology is my <em>JAM</em>. I do have an official
            blog on <a href="https://blog.noobscience.rocks">Hashnode</a> but I wanted a more
            personal space to write about my thoughts and ideas. I am a big fan of
            the vanilla web and I wanted to build this blog from scratch. I am using
            nothing but HTML, CSS and JavaScript. No CMS. No frameworks. No libraries.
        </p>

                    <p>
                        Torrenting and peer-to-peer sharing are decentralized ways of sharing files between computers, making it
                        difficult to
                        control exclusive access or censor content. Torrenting is often considered illegal in many countries, as
                        it enables
                        piracy by allowing users to share files with others on the network.
                        Is it really that bad?

            Okay, as you can see I want to be not talking about technology, but it
            leaks into my words. Anyways, this is a place I just randomly share my thoughts.
            There's a plan for more improvements and features, but for now, this is it.
            If you want to discuss something, please feel free to reach out on <i class="bi bi-twitter"></i><a href="https://twitter.com/noobscience1">Twitter</a>

            I hope you enjoy your stay here. I'll try to keep this blog updated as much

        <h2>
            Trying something out
        </h2>
        <p>
            I have been thinking about this for quite a while now and I want to try it
            out. So this blog is a subsidiary of the main site <a href="https://noobscience.rocks">NoobScience</a> and 
            is hosted on the same server. The code is available on <i class="bi bi-github"></i>
            <a href="https://github.com/newtoallofthis123/About">GitHub</a>.
            So, if you want to write a article on this blog, you can just fork the repo,
            write your article and send a pull request. I'll review it and merge it.
            Cool Right ?! Feel free to try it out. More info and guidelines <em>coming soon</em>.
