                <span class="first">O</span>kay, let's do a quick age quiz. Do you know what was napster?<br> 
                Napster was a peer-to-peer file sharing service that was launched in 1999.
                It was the first of its kind and it was a huge hit. It was shut down in 2001
                after a legal battle with the music industry. It was the first time that
                the music industry had to deal with piracy on such a large scale.

            <h2>Torrents and P2P?</h2>
            <p>
                First, for the non technical people, let's talk about torrents and P2P.
                Peer to Peer sharing or <em>torrenting</em> is a way of sharing files
                between computers. It is a decentralized system where there is no central
                server. The files are shared between the computers that are connected to
                the network.
            </p>

                <img src="static/images/p2p.webp" width="480" alt="Peer to Peer system">
                <p class="courtesy">Wiki Commons</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Now the way you can control your exclusive access to pretty much anything
                you offer and basically <em>censor</em> by using a central server. This
                is reduced to ashes by the P2P system. Since, in this, there is no central
                entity that can control the flow of data. This is why torrenting is
                considered illegal in many countries.
            </p>
            <h2>How it works for piracy</h2>
            <p>
                So let's say you have downloaded a movie. You have the file on your
                computer. Now, you want to share it with your friends. You now
                torrent the file to your friends. This meaning that basically, the torrenting
                software on your computer will connect to the torrenting software on your
                friends computer and share the file.
                Now when your friends share the file with their friends, the bits and pieces of
                the file are shared with your friends and your friends friends.
