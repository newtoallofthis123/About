            <h2 id="welcome-back">Welcome Back</h2>
            <p>First off, if you have not read the previous <a href="/blog/articles/social-media-1.html">part 1</a> of this series,
                I highly recommend you do so. This article is going to be a direct continuation of my previous article.</p>
            <p>We were discussing about how social media apps store your online personality. We were also talking about the
                Cambridge Analytica Scandal and the problems with these apps storing your identity.</p>
            <p>Now you might be observing that I am not really giving you solutions to all the problems. At least not yet. I plan on
                doing a whole other segment on the solutions. Those are after all the end goal.</p>
            <p>Now, with all that out of the way, that get back into the discussion. And once again, remember, if you find any issue
                or you have any suggestions, please reach out to me on <a href="https://twitter.com/noobscience1">twitter.com</a> or
                just edit the page over on <a href="">github.com</a>.</p>
            <h2 id="mental-health">Mental Health</h2>
            <p>Now, I don&#39;t want to reveal too much writing this article, but this is what you should know. I was a student who
                didn&#39;t do well in an entrance exam and was student at a credible institution. So most of classmates, did do
                well.
                If you live in India, I am sure you were already able to fill up the blanks. Anyways, moving on, as you can guess,
                this was not the most ideal time for me to be on social media. Yet I was. And the whole process was very disturbing
                to me and I was deeply unhappy for quite some time. The worst part was, I was not able to pin point as to what was
                causing me all this anxiety. </p>
            <p>I was not happy with my placement and was always comparing my situation to others. The <em>Instagram stories</em>,
                The status updates, everything were only driving me deeper and deeper into the black hole. And the people posting
                were not wrong. They were my friends. They were not doing anything wrong.</p>
            <p>This is what I wanted to talk about with you guys in this segment. Set aside for some time the social media apps, the
                companies, the data, the everything and just ask this. Was social media meant to be for humans? Now I know we are
                going into the territory of philosophy and I don&#39;t want to talk or seem existential. But were we as humans
                really meant to have so many digital interactions? Were we biologically programmed to handled so much surges of
                dopamine and all of the other things that accompany social media? I don&#39;t think we were [1].</p>
            <p>One more topic I want to briefly touch at, but I want you to not take my opinion for a fact because well, I am not a
                girl. It has been found in recent studies that teenage girls are more depressed than ever. Well, don&#39;t get me
                wrong, boys are quite depressed too, but for reasons that are far different from that of girls. I am sure I would
                feel &quot;not enough&quot; if I see a super model, who spends millions on her body, and has every detail to
                perfection.
                This is not something that can be helped. Maybe you can set an age limit to social media, but then again, how would
                you verify? Your identity card? So you are okay with associating your social media with your real life identity? I
                don&#39;t think that&#39;s a good idea.</p>
            <h2 id="dopamine-please">Dopamine Please?</h2>
            <p>You know the meme, that now a day, you don&#39;t really laugh at your phone. You just sigh. I don&#39;t think our
                laughter suddenly reducing to a sigh is a mere coincidence. We as humans are becoming more anxious and more
                depressed than ever. Why is it that we no longer get the same excitement from our phone? Are we just bored? So tell
                me, what do you do when you are bored? You seek out new things to do, don&#39;t you. You seek out new, better
                content, even funnier, even informative, even provocative, all to satisfy quench your thirst that is your boredom.
