        How a Chinese Billionaire built her fortune
    </h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Zhou took up a job of polishing glass, which required her to work from 8 am to 12 pm. This was her initial work,
            and she had to work hard to be able to polish the glass.</li>
        <li>Zhou left her job and set up her own company because the work was monotonous, and the hours were long. She
            needed to work from 8 to 12 pm to polish glass.</li>
        <li>The advent of mobile phones made Ms. Zhou a billionaire. In 2003, she received an offer from mobile giant
            Motorola to make screens for mobile phones. Zhou got on board and created the screens for Motorola's Razr V3.
            From then on, glass screens started replacing plastic screens, which are more scratch-resistant and provide
            sharper images for texts and multimedia.</li>
        <li>Ms. Zhou is obsessive about the standards maintained in her factory. Much of Zhou's skill of making lenses is
            self-taught. She began to try out ways of improving the quality of the lenses that she sold. Soon she acquired a
            reputation for making the finest watch lens available in the market.</li>
        <li>Zhou Qunfei is different from other girls in her village because she left school at sixteen and chose to work
            and run a business. She was the youngest of the three children born to a skilled craftsman.</li>
        <li>Zhou Qunfei was born in a small village in China, and she was the youngest of the three children born to a
            skilled craftsman. She lost her mother at the age of five, and she had to help her family by raising ducks and
            pigs for their livelihood. Despite being a brilliant student, she dropped out of school and landed a job at the
            age of sixteen.</li>
        <li>To manufacture watch lenses, the glass is cut, ground to size, bored and polished to give each plate a
            transparent finish. Then, the plates are fortified in a potassium ion bath, cured and painted. Finally, they are
            coated with anti-smudge and anti-reflection films. The glass manufactured in this procedure is more resistant to
            scratches and provides sharper images for texts and multimedia.</li>
