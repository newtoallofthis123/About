    <h1>Unit 1: Introduction to Design Thinking</h1>
    <p>
        <em>Design Thinking</em> is a human-centered approach to problem solving that draws from the designer's toolkit
        to
        integrate the needs of people, the possibilities of technology, and the requirements for business success.

    <p>Design thinking is a 5 step process involving</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Empathize: Requirement Gathering, interviews, field visits</li>
        <li>Define: Define the problem and arrive at the problem statement</li>
        <li>Ideate: Come up with a lot of ideas for the problem</li>
        <li>Prototype: Build a test prototype using current technologies</li>
        <li>Test: Get user feedback for the model and iterate if necessary</li>
    </ol>

    </ul>
    <h2 id="challenges-in-design-thinking">Challenges in Design thinking:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><em>Normal Problem</em>: The problem statement is clear and it has a viable solution that can be easily
            tested.
            They are well defined problems. The solution is available through technical knowledge</li>
        <li><em>Wicked Problems</em>: They are ill defined problems. In this, the problem statement is not very clear
            and it
            is up to the design thinkers to both define the problem and come up with a viable solution to the problem.
            In
            this, significant time goes into requirement analysis and gathering. Problem shaping, problem definition and
            requirement analysis is a huge part of solving such problems</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 id="what-is-design-thinking">What is Design Thinking:</h2>
    <p>Design thinking is a process and mindset for creatively and systematically solving complex problems. It is a way of
        thinking and working that is human-centred, collaborative, and iterative. </p>
    <h2 id="design-thinking-process">Design Thinking Process</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Empathy: (i) Interview (ii) Observation (iii) Experience</li>
        <li>Define: PoV = persona + need + insight</li>
        <li>Ideate: Diverge (Create Choices), Converge (Make Decisions)</li>
        <li>Prototype: ‘Prototype is worth a thousand meeting’</li>

    </ol>
    <h2 id="design-thinking-non-linear-process">Design Thinking Non Linear Process:</h2>
    <p>Design thinking is a non-linear process because it involves a cyclical and iterative approach to problem solving. It
        starts with a broad and open-ended exploration of the problem space, followed by the identification of specific
        areas to focus on and the development of potential solutions. These solutions are then tested and refined through
        prototypes and experiments, and the process is repeated until a satisfactory solution is found. </p>

    <p>Business pitches are a great way to get your ideas across to investors for funding.</p>
    <h2 id="what-is-a-pitch">What is a pitch?</h2>
    <p>A pitch is a short presentation that you give to investors to get funding for your business. It can be sit down
        discussion or a presentation. There are three types of pitches:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>30 sec - Elevator Pitch</li>

        <li>20 minute - Oh Fuck!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="30-sec-pitch">30 sec Pitch</h2>
    <p>This is also known as the elevator pitch. It is a short pitch that you give to investors in an elevator. It should be
        short and sweet. It should be to the point.</p>
    <ul>
        <li><em>KISS</em>: Keep it simple stupid.</li>
        <li>Cut Technical jargon</li>
        <li>7 sec to form good impression</li>

    </blockquote>
    <h2 id="20-minute-pitch">20 Minute Pitch</h2>
    <p>In a 20 minute pitch, you can go into more detail about your business. We can do this with a 10/20/30 rule. This
        means:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>10 slides</li>
        <li>20 minutes</li>
        <li>30 point font</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The 10 slides should include stuff like: Cover, Problem, Solution, Market, Competition, Team, Business Model,
        Financials, Milestones, and Q&amp;A.</p>
