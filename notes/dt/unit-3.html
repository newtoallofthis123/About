    <h1>Personas: Unit 3</h1>
    <h2>What is a Persona</h2>
    <p>
        <em>A Persona is a realistic character sketch representing one segment of a targeted audience.</em>
        They are fictional characters that represent a group of people with similar characteristics, needs, and goals.
        Personas are used to help designers and developers understand the needs of the people they are designing for.
        Personas are not meant to be a complete representation of a person, but rather a representation of a group of people.
        <br><u>Great persona's can:</u>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Bring Focus</li>
        <li>Build Empathy</li>
        <li>Encourage consensus</li>
        <li>Create Efficiency</li>
        <li>Lead to better decisions.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>
        Demographics vs Personas
    </h2>
    <p>
        Demographics include things like age, gender, race, and income bracket: pretty basic stuff. Personas, on the other
        hand, dig into the personality of the customer,
        focusing on what makes them who they are, and what drives them to seek out the services or products you offer.
        This is where you get into the nitty-gritty of what makes your customers tick.
        Hence the name, persona.
    </p>
    <p>
        For example, let's say you're designing a new website for a local restaurant. You might create a persona for a
        typical customer, like a 30-year-old professional who lives in the area and is looking for a place to take a date.
        You might also create a persona for a typical employee, like a 20-year-old college student who works part-time
        while going to school.
        Even though two rich people come under the same demographic, they are very different people.
    </p>

    <h2>Proto Personas</h2>
    <p>
        Fictional representations of real personas are called proto personas. Proto personas are used to help you
        understand your users better.
        <u>Advantages of Proto Personas</u>
    </p>
    <ol>
        <li>Fast of Produce</li>
        <li>Avoid Designing for everyone</li>
        <li>Discovering Assumptions and Misconceptions.</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>How to Create a Persona</h2>
    <p>
        <u>Step 1: User Research</u>
        <br>
        The first step in creating a persona is to conduct user research. This is where you learn about your users.
        Answer the following questions: 
        Who are your users and why are they using the system? 
        What behaviors, assumptions, and expectations color their view of the system?
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Step 2: Condense the research</u>
        <br>
        Look for themes/characteristics that are specific, relevant, and universal to the system and its
        users.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Step 3: Brainstorm</u>
        <br>
        Organize elements into persona groups that represent your target users. Name or classify each group.
        Refine: Combine and prioritize the rough personas. Separate them into primary, secondary, and, if necessary,
        complementary categories. You should have roughly 3-5 personas and their identified characteristics.
    </p>
    <p>
        <u>Step 4: Make them realistic</u>
        <br>
        Develop the appropriate descriptions of each personas background, motivations, and expectations. Do
        not include a lot of personal information. Be
        relevant and serious; humor is not appropriate.
    </p>
    <h2>
        Types of Personas
    </h2>
    <ol>
        <li>
            <u>Goal-directed persona: </u>
            It focusses on: “What does my typical user want to do with my product?”. The objective of
            a goal-directed persona is to examine the process and workflow that
            your user would prefer to utilise with your product or service.
        </li>
        <li>
            <u>Role Based Persona: </u>
            This persona is based on the role that the user plays in the
            organization. It focusses on: “What does my typical user do in my
            organization?”.
        </li>
        <li>
            <u>Engaging persona: </u>
            This persona is based on the user’s emotional state. It focusses on:
            “What does my typical user feel about my product?”.
        </li>
        <li>
            <u>Fictional persona: </u>
            Unlike others, this persona is not based on real users. It focusses
            on: “What does my typical user want to do with my product?”. Work Flows and stuff
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h1>Pitching Techniques: Unit 5</h1>
    <p>
        Business pitches are a great way to get your ideas across to investors for funding.
    </p>
    <h2>What is a pitch?</h2>
    <p>
        A pitch is a short presentation that you give to investors to get funding for your business.
        It can be sit down discussion or a presentation.
        There are three types of pitches:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>30 sec - Elevator Pitch</li>
        <li>3 minute - Story Pitch</li>
        <li>20 minute - Oh Fuck!</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>30 sec Pitch</h2>
    <p>
        This is also known as the elevator pitch. It is a short pitch that you give to investors in an elevator.
        It should be short and sweet. It should be to the point.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>
        <em>KISS</em>: Keep it simple stupid.
        </li>
        <li>Cut Technical jargon</li>
        <li>7 sec to form good impression</li>
        <li>Message Map: </li>
    </ul>
    <div>
        <img src="static/message-map.webp" width="120" alt="Message Map">
    </div>
    <h2>3 Minute Pitch</h2>
    <p>
        This is also known as the story pitch. It is a medium length pitch that you give to investors.
        It should be medium length. It should be to the point.
    </p>

        People don't buy what you do, they buy what you believe.
        <br>
        <em>-Simon Sinek</em>
    </blockquote>
    <h2>
        20 Minute Pitch
    </h2>
    <p>
        In a 20 minute pitch, you can go into more detail about your business.
        We can do this with a 10/20/30 rule.
        This means:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>10 slides</li>
        <li>20 minutes</li>
        <li>30 point font</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        The 10 slides should include stuff like:
        Cover, Problem, Solution, Market, Competition, Team, Business Model, Financials, Milestones, and Q&A.
    </p>
    <h2>All the best for your DT Exam :)</h2>
