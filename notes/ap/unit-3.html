	<h2>LED : Light Emitting Diode</h2>
	<p>
		<u>Summary: </u><br>
		PN Juntion diode that is foward biased.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Amout of light is directly proportional to foward current
		</li>
		<li>
			hν = Eg <br>
			hc/λ = Eg <br>
			λ = hc/ Eg
		</li>
		<li>
			Hence, the wavelength ie color depends on Energy Gap of Semi conductor.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Construction of LED</h2>
	<p>
		Light is generated <em>perpendicular</em> to the apparatus.
		<br>
		The n type layer is grown on a substrate and p type is grown on it using difussion.
		<br>
		P type layer is very thin to prevent loss of photons during emmission.
		<br>
		The device is surrounded in epoxy resin to prevent loss of photons due to TIR.

	<h2>Working of LED</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The PN Juntion is foward biased so e<sup>-</sup> go to p<sup>+</sup>
		</li>
		<li>
			Photos are released due to the recombination of these electrons with holes. This effect is called injection electro luminicence.
		</li>
		<li>
			Recombination happens in two kinds -> Direct and Indirect.

	<h3>Subtopic: Internal Photoelectric Effect</h3>
	<p>
		When a light of suitable wavelength is incident on an intrinsic semiconductor, electrons are excited from valence to conduction band.
		<br>
		It is similar to actual photoelectric effect, but this just happens inside the semi conductor and results in the generation of a electron hole pair.
	</p>
	<h3>Subtopic: Photoconductive Effect</h3>
	<p>
		If the amount of free charge carriers are increased in a semi conductor, the photo conductivity increases leading to the release of more photons
	</p>
	<h2>PhotoDectors</h2>
	<p>
		These are used to detect light by first converting optical energy to electric energy and measuring the electric energy.
		These are <em>Revere biased</em> pn junction diodes.
		<br>
		Operate on the principal of internal photoelectric effect.
		When a photon is incident on the junction, a electron hole pair is generated.
		<br>
		The hole is attracted to the n type layer and the electron is attracted to the p type layer.
		<br>
		This causes a current to flow in the circuit.
