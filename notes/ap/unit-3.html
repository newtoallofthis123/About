	<h2>LED : Light Emitting Diode</h2>
	<p>
		<u>Summary: </u><br>
		PN Junction diode that is forward biased.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Amount of light is directly proportional to forward current
		</li>
		<li>
			hν = Eg <br>
			hc/λ = Eg <br>
			λ = hc/ Eg
		</li>
		<li>
			Hence, the wavelength ie color depends on Energy Gap of Semi conductor.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Construction of LED</h2>
	<p>
		Light is generated <em>perpendicular</em> to the apparatus.
		<br>
		The n type layer is grown on a substrate and p type is grown on it using diffusion.
		<br>
		P type layer is very thin to prevent loss of photons during emission.
		<br>
		The device is surrounded in epoxy resin to prevent loss of photons due to TIR.

	<h2>Working of LED</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The PN Junction is forward biased so e<sup>-</sup> go to p<sup>+</sup>
		</li>
		<li>
			Photos are released due to the recombination of these electrons with holes. This effect is called injection electro luminicence.
		</li>
		<li>
			Recombination happens in two kinds -> Direct and Indirect.

	<h2>Applications</h2>

		<li>Watches</li>
		<li>Display Boards</li>
		<li>Anything with Light :)</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Subtopic: Internal Photoelectric Effect</h3>
	<p>
		When a light of suitable wavelength is incident on an intrinsic semiconductor, electrons are excited from valence to conduction band.
		<br>
		It is similar to actual photoelectric effect, but this just happens inside the semi conductor and results in the generation of a electron hole pair.
	</p>
	<h3>Subtopic: Photoconductive Effect</h3>
	<p>
		If the amount of free charge carriers are increased in a semi conductor, the photo conductivity increases leading to the release of more photons
	</p>
	<h2>PhotoDetectors</h2>
	<p>
		These are used to detect light by first converting optical energy to electric energy and measuring the electric energy.
		These are <em>Revere biased</em> pn junction diodes.
		<br>
		Operate on the principal of internal photoelectric effect.
		When a photon is incident on the junction, a electron hole pair is generated.
		<br>
		The hole is attracted to the n type layer and the electron is attracted to the p type layer.
		<br>
		The electric field due to the immobile charges in the depletion layer causes the electron to move to the n type layer and the hole to move to the p type layer.
	</p>
	<h3>Photoconductive Mode</h3>
	<p>
		Device is reverse biased and left at short circuit.
		<br>
		Dark currents ie current due to minority carriers flows.
		<br>
		Increase in depletion layer width due to the generation of electron hole pair.
	</p>
	<h3>Photovoltaic Mode</h3>
	<p>
		Device is left at open circuit.
		<br>
		Current is generated due to the flow of electrons from n type to p type.
		<br>
		The diode is not biased hence no dark currents flow.
		<br>
		This is the mode of operation in solar cells.
	</p>
	<h2>Types of PhotoDetectors</h2>
	<p>
		PhotoDetectors are mainly of two types:
		<ul>
			<li>PIN</li>
			<li>Avalanche Detector</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h3>PIN: PhotoDetector</h3>
	<div>
		<img src="static/pin.png" alt="PIN PhotoDetector">
	</div>
	<p>
		Device consisting of a p type layer, an intrinsic layer and an n type layer.
		The p type layer is heavily doped and the n type layer is lightly doped.
		<br>
		The intrinsic layer is grown on top of the p type layer and the n type layer is grown on top of the intrinsic layer.
		<br>
		The intrinsic layer acts as the depletion region.
		<br>
		<em>PIN PhotoDetector is reversed biased</em>
		<br>
		When a photon having energy greater than or equal to band gap energy is incident on the depletion region, then
		electron-hole pairs are generated.
