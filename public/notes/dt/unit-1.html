            They are well defined problems. The solution is available through technical knowledge</li>
        <li><em>Wicked Problems</em>: They are ill defined problems. In this, the problem statement is not very clear and it
            is up to the design thinkers to both define the problem and come up with a viable solution to the problem. In
            this, significant time goes into requirement analysis and gathering. Problem shaping, problem definition and
            requirement analysis is a huge part of solving such problems</li>
    </ul>
