    <h2>Why is user empathy important?</h2>
    <p>
        User empathy is important because it helps you to understand the user's needs and feelings. It helps you to
        understand the user's perspective. It helps you to understand the user's problems and goals
    </p>
    <h2>Assuming a Beginner's Mindset</h2>
    <p>
        When you are designing a product, you should assume a beginner's mindset. You should assume that the user
        knows nothing about your product. You should assume that the user is a beginner. You should assume that the
        user is a novice.
    </p>
    <h2>How to develop user empathy?</h2>

            Ask the user what they want to do with your product. Ask the user why they want to do that. Ask the user
            how they want to do that.
        </li>
        <li>
            <u>Photo and Video: </u>
            Take photos and videos of the user using your product. Watch the videos and photos of the user using your
            product.
        </li>
