    <h1>LASERS</h1>
    <h2 id="intro">Intro</h2>
    <p>Lasers are coherent light sources which are produced through stimulated emission
        The acronym LASER stands for <strong>L</strong>ight <strong>A</strong>mplification by <strong>S</strong>timulated
        <strong>E</strong>mission of <strong>R</strong>adiation.</p>
    <h2 id="characteristics-of-lasers">Characteristics of LASERs</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Directionality (Uni directional)</li>
        <li>High Intensity (More focused in a small area)</li>
        <li>Mono Chromaticity (One specific color)</li>
        <li>Coherent (High degree of coherence)</li>
    </ol>
    <h2 id="requirements-of-a-laser">Requirements of a LASER</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Population Inversion</li>
        <li>Meta Stable State </li>
        <li>Active Medium (Medium in which the laser action takes place)</li>
        <li>Resonating Cavity</li>
        <li>Pumping (Large number of e<sup>-</sup>s from lower to higher)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Population Inversion</p>
    <div>

    <p>In the resonating cavity, one mirror is fully reflected while other is only partially reflected. This actually allows
        laser to come out. It is used to <em>increase photon density</em> by multiple reflections and is the reason for
        amplification</p>
    <h2 id="solid-state-laser-ruby-laser">Solid State LASER: Ruby Laser</h2>
    <p><img src="static/ruby_laser.png" alt="Ruby Laser"></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ruby is Al<sub>2</sub>O<sub>3</sub> crystal with about 0.05% Chromium Atoms </li>
        <li>In this, Cr<sup>+3</sup> atoms are the active material.</li>
        <li>It&#39;s ends are polished. It also has a cylindrical resonating cavity</li>
        <li>Ruby rod acts as an <em>optical resonator</em></li>
        <li>It is surrounded by a helical <em>Xenon Flash Lamp</em> used for pumping
            <img src="static/rl_diagram.png" alt="Ruby Laser Diagram">
        </li>
        <li>This is a spontaneous emmision (6934 arm - red)</li>
        <li>Here, E2 is the meta stable state. Cr undergoes non radiative transmission.</li>
        <li>After this process, a photon is released which further excites the down atom. (1.79 ev)</li>
        <li>The output is not continues but pulsed.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="helium-neon-laser">Helium Neon LASER</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>More focused and have sharp energy levels.</li>
        <li>Consists of a long discharge tube connected to a high 10kv voltage</li>
        <li>Laser action is due to <em>neon gas</em> and they are excited by <em>helium gas</em></li>
        <li>Once again, one mirror is partially reflecting whereas the other is reflecting</li>
    </ul>
    <p><img src="static/neon_laser.png" alt="Helium Neon Laser"></p>
    <ul>
        <li>When switched is on, electrons and ions produced in the discharge tube collide with helium and neon atoms</li>
        <li>Helium gets more easily excited then Neon</li>
        <li>Energy levels F2, F3 of Helium are close to E4, E6 of Neon</li>
        <li>When helium atoms collide with neon atoms, they transfer energy. This is called resonant energy transfer</li>
        <li>E6 is the meta stable state and transitions from E6 to E3 produce wavelength 6328A</li>
        <li>Other wavelengths are eliminated</li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="semi-conductor-laser">Semi Conductor Laser</h2>
    <p>Semiconductor lasers are of two types. Except the Construction, Principle and working are same for both.</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Homojunction semiconductor Laser (Same Band gap energies)</li>
        <li>Hetrojunction semiconductor Laser (Different Band gap energies)</li>
    </ol>
    <ul>
        <li>Instead of laser light being generated from energy levels, transitions take place from valence to conduction
            band</li>
        <li>Laser light is produced due to recombination of electrons and holes at pn-junction when current is passed
            through the diode. </li>
        <li>Laser light is due to stimulated emission.</li>
        <li>When current is passed through pn junction under forward bias, the injected electrons and holes will increase
            the density of electrons in CB and holes in VB. </li>
        <li>As the current is further increased at some threshold value of current the amplification will takes place and
            laser begin to emit coherent radiation.</li>
        <li>The properties of semi conductor laser depend upon the energy gap.</li>
    </ul>
