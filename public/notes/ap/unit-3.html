	<h2>LED : Light Emitting Diode</h2>
	<p>
		<u>Summary: </u><br>
		PN Junction diode that is forward biased.
	</p>
	<ul>
		<li>
			Amount of light is directly proportional to forward current
		</li>
		<li>
			hν = Eg <br>
			hc/λ = Eg <br>
			λ = hc/ Eg
		</li>
		<li>
			Hence, the wavelength ie color depends on Energy Gap of Semi conductor.
		</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>Construction of LED</h2>
	<p>
		Light is generated <em>perpendicular</em> to the apparatus.
		<br>
		The n type layer is grown on a substrate and p type is grown on it using diffusion.
		<br>
		P type layer is very thin to prevent loss of photons during emission.
		<br>
		The device is surrounded in epoxy resin to prevent loss of photons due to TIR.

	<h2>Working of LED</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>
			The PN Junction is forward biased so e<sup>-</sup> go to p<sup>+</sup>
		</li>
		<li>
			Photos are released due to the recombination of these electrons with holes. This effect is called injection electro luminicence.
		</li>
		<li>
			Recombination happens in two kinds -> Direct and Indirect.

	<h2>Applications</h2>
	<ul>
		<li>Watches</li>
		<li>Display Boards</li>
		<li>Anything with Light :)</li>
	</ul>
	<h3>Subtopic: Internal Photoelectric Effect</h3>
	<p>
		When a light of suitable wavelength is incident on an intrinsic semiconductor, electrons are excited from valence to conduction band.
		<br>
		It is similar to actual photoelectric effect, but this just happens inside the semi conductor and results in the generation of a electron hole pair.
	</p>
	<h3>Subtopic: Photoconductive Effect</h3>
	<p>
		If the amount of free charge carriers are increased in a semi conductor, the photo conductivity increases leading to the release of more photons
	</p>
	<h2>PhotoDetectors</h2>
	<p>
		These are used to detect light by first converting optical energy to electric energy and measuring the electric energy.
		These are <em>Revere biased</em> pn junction diodes.
		<br>
		Operate on the principal of internal photoelectric effect.
		When a photon is incident on the junction, a electron hole pair is generated.
		<br>
		Light from the source is incident on the junction.
		The energy is used to excite the electrons from valence band to conduction band.
		This leaves a hole in the valence band.
		<br>
		An electric field is created within the detector, which causes the electrons and holes to be separated and moved in
		opposite directions.
		The electric field is generated by intrinsic layer or depletion layer.
		<br>
		This <em>seperation</em> causes current.
	</p>
	<h3>Photoconductive Mode</h3>
	<p>
		Device is reverse biased and left at short circuit.
		<br>
		Dark currents ie current due to minority carriers flows.
		<br>
		Increase in depletion layer width due to the generation of electron hole pair.
	</p>
	<h3>Photovoltaic Mode</h3>
	<p>
		Device is left at open circuit.
		<br>
		Current is generated due to the flow of electrons from n type to p type.
		<br>
		The diode is not biased hence no dark currents flow.
		<br>
		This is the mode of operation in solar cells.
	</p>
	<h2>Types of PhotoDetectors</h2>
	<p>
		PhotoDetectors are mainly of two types:
		<ul>
			<li>PIN</li>
			<li>Avalanche Detector</li>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<h3>PIN: PhotoDetector</h3>
	<div>
		<img src="static/pin.png" alt="PIN PhotoDetector">
	</div>
	<p>
		Device consisting of a p type layer, an intrinsic layer and an n type layer.
		The p type layer is heavily doped and the n type layer is lightly doped.
		<br>
		The intrinsic layer is grown on top of the p type layer and the n type layer is grown on top of the intrinsic layer.
		<br>
		The intrinsic layer acts as the depletion region.
		<br>
		<em>PIN PhotoDetector is reversed biased</em>
		<br>
		When a photon having energy greater than or equal to band gap energy is incident on the depletion region, then
		electron-hole pairs are generated.
		<br>
		The high electric field present in the depletion region cause the electron-hole pair generated by the photon to separate
		and be collected across the reverse biased junction. This gives rise to a current flow in the external circuit.
		<br>
		The depletion layer is large enough to capture all photons effectively and <em>The dark currents are minimum.</em>
